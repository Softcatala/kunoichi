kunoichi (0.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jordi Mallach ]
  * Try using the VE's hostname if it has no name assigned.
  * Add an optional "delay" feature to be able to program backups on
    more flexible moments (ie, weekly, etc).
  * Fix at-helper's help text.

  [ Sergio Talens-Oliag ]
  * Upload new version with Dani's changes (support for LVM volumes with - on
    their names)

kunoichi (0.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Get the CTX of vservers directly from /etc/vservers, as vserver-stat
    can't show any info for non-running servers.
  * Reinstall atd jobs at 6:59, to avoid logcheck warnings at 7:00.

kunoichi (0.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a syntax error in kvm_savevm().
  * Don't quote arguments for vserver exec, they are unecessary unlike with
    vzctl.
  * Move execution of backupninja runs into the main for loop of OpenVZ and
    VServer methods. This way, backupninja operations are run just before
    the rdiff-backup is done for each virtual server.
  * Similarly, do savevm's just before rdiffing a kvm image.
  * Backup the host after all the virtual servers.
  * Change the target dir for OpenVZ and VServer backups, appending a
    "cluster name" directory to the tree, and use "name.numid" as the
    final backup dir. This reduces the possibility of backing up different
    servers on the same rdiff-backup.
  * Make the cluster name configurable, to allow overriding badly detected
    cluster names.
  * Workaround braindead output from vzlist.
  * Use vzlist instead of find to avoid backing up migrated OpenVZs, as
    vzlist will ignore "destroyed" container configurations.
  * Move away from CDBS, use a single dh call.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3, no changes needed.
  * Don't stop backing up the virtual server if backupninja is not installed.

kunoichi (0.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Print the status of the LVM snapshot after every rdiff-backup run.
    If the snapshot was full, show a warning, as the backup will most
    probably be incomplete.
  * Add start & stop markers for each backup in logs.
  * Remove extra / in OpenVZ method, that cause problems when globbing.
  * Fix quoting for backupninja executions, getting rid of the mysterious
    "-n" bug.
  * Fix generation of $SNAP_PATH when mountpoint is /.
  * Fix conditional excludes for KVM.
  * Avoid exiting the backupninja function after it has run only on the first
    server.
  * Move the list of running OpenVZs to /var/run/kunoichi, which is a safer
    location.
  * Bump requirement on python-xattr to >= 0.4, which matches etch-backports
    and lenny, and gets rid of a rdiff-backup warning.
  * Suggest socat, which is used for KVM methods.
  * Rename one of the two independent uses of KVM_NBD to USE_KVM_NBD.
  * Adapt non-nbd KVM method to individual snapshot creation.
  * Silence a use of egrep if the file isn't found.
  * Minor cleanups.

kunoichi (0.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't limit the maximum size of a snapshot even if the number of
    available PE's is really huge. Set the lower limit to 1GB and abort
    if that amount is not available.
  * Rename $TEST_SNAP_SIZE to $SNAP_SIZE to enable this support, and use
    vg_free_count (free physical extents) to create the snapshot, as
    lvcreate does not support providing the snapshot size in bytes.
  * Don't use a cron.d script. Use iti-backup-tool's at-helper, adapted
    for kunoichi's needs.
  * Split configuration files for easier cluster customisation.
  * Move configuration files to iti-kunoichi. By default, installing only
    kunoichi won't work due to lack of configuration files.
  * Rename host method to root, in advance for multiple LVM snapshot support.
  * Support two kinds of includes/excludes for root backups: absolute, for
    paths outside the LVM, and relative, for paths insided the LVM.
  * Check that any component of the backup dir is a mountpoint, not just
    the destination dir.
  * Remove binddir support, as there's too many places where it fails to do
    its intended job.
  * Support a PRE and POST backup command, via the {PRE,POST}_RCOMMAND
    variables.
  * Do not exclude devices, fifos or sockets.

kunoichi (0.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New spring, new backup system. :)
  * Initial version.
  * Part of the code is taken from iti-server-backup, included in 
    iti-backup-tools.
